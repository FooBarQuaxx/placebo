Placebo
=======

Placebo is a utility that help mocks api responses in a reusable way.

(WORK IN PROGRESS)

Sample mock:
::

   class UsersResponse(BaseMock):

       url = 'http://www.acme.com/api/v1/users/'
       body = json.dumps([{'name': 'Huseyin',
                           'last_name': 'Yilmaz'}])

       method = 'GET'


And usage of the mock will be like this:

::

   @Response.mock
   def users_api_test(self):
       ...


It will also work on views

::

   @Response.mock
   def users_list_view(request):
       ...


Details
=======

When a decorator is applied, I will be using httppretty or httmock libraries to mock
given endpoint from the socket or requests library layer. So I am thinking about creating a
backend structure that can be attach to the library. So I will be able switch between different
mocking library backends.

Bad side of this is I will need to create a generic structure and convert specific backend requests to generic PlaceboRequest backend.

Backends:
---------
I am thinking about creating 2 backends for now httpretty and httmock. In my expericence, httmock is a lot better choice for some usecases because httpretty cannot be applied on runtime. It must be applied on initialization. (This is not an issue for 90% of use cases.).

LastRequests:
-------------
To test request data, I will need to catch requests and provide some kind interface so request can be inspected on tests. interface for this can be a function on main module like placebo.get_last_reqest()

Debug mode:
-----------
This abstraction is good. But when urls needs to be updated it becomes really hard to debug those kind of interfaces. So there should be a debug mod that prints out all decision to console.

Regexp URL's
------------
There should be a way to define urls with some kind of regexp. For some cases, we might want to be able to mock whole sub directories.
